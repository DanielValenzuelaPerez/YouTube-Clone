# YouTube Clone

**🚧👷 Project under constructrion 🏗️🚧**

The main goal of this project is to create the basic functionality of the YouTube site. 

## Functional Requirements

* Users can create accounts.
* Each user can search, click on and watch videos.
* Videos have a name, description, upload date, and owner.
* Videos have statistics: likes, dislikes, and views.
* Users can like or dislike videos.
* Users can create playlists of videos.
* Users can become content creators and have videos in their channel.
* Each user has their own channel.
* A user can subscribe to channels.

## Limitations
Video files will not be supported in the database. Instead, the project will use the YouTube API to imitate the content of the website. However, the statistics of each video will be based on the interaction within the project, not from the original videos.
The focus of this project is to imitate the functionalities of the YouTube website; therefore, the web pages will have a basic design.
