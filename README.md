**🚧👷 Project under constructrion 🏗️🚧**

The main goal of this project is to imitate the basic functionality of the YouTube site. 

## Functional Requirements

* The system allows for user account creation. 
* Users are able to search for, select, and view videos which have a title, description, upload date, and creator. 
* Videos also have metrics such as likes, dislikes, and views. 
* Users can like or dislike videos. 
* Users can comment and leave replies on videos.
* Users can also create and manage video playlists.
* Users can become content creators and have videos in their channel.
* Users can subsribe to other channels.

## Limitations
Video files will not be supported in the database. Instead, the project will use the YouTube API to display the content in the website. However, the statistics of each video will be based on the interaction within the project, not from the original videos.
The focus of this project is to imitate the functionalities of the YouTube website; therefore, the web pages will have a basic design.
